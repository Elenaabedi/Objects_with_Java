# Objects_with_Java

Small simulation about how a computer program of a university would work. With it, we can obtain a list of teachers, students and subjects.

The process is simple, once the program is executed, a list of possibilities appears. We only have to type the number of the list we want to run and press enter.

# How to deploy the project

1. Download and install NetBeans IDE (if not already installed).
2. Launch NetBeans IDE.
3. Open the downloaded project in NetBeans by going to "File" > "Open Project" and selecting the project folder.
4. Once the project is opened, navigate to the main Java class file that contains the main method.
5. Run the program by clicking the green "Play" button or pressing "Shift + F6".
6. The program will be compiled and executed, and the output will be displayed in the "Output" window at the bottom of the IDE.

Make sure you have the necessary JDK installed and configured in NetBeans. You can check this by going to "Tools" > "Java Platforms" and ensuring that a valid JDK is listed.
